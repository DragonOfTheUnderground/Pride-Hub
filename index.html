<p><small>Compiled by Firethorn</small></p>
<p>These sites contain content on the Pride Community. As of June 18, 2024, many people fear that bills such as KOSA will prevent people from gaining access to these resources. Losing this access would harm members of the Pride Community both physically and mentally, especially ones who haven't uncovered their idenities yet.</p>
<p>My instructions are simple: keep these files on a USB or another storage medium (please don't zip it as that reduces quality). If a censorship bill passes, please share this collection, especially if you think someone you know might need it. Even if such a bill hasn't passed, you may still share this with others, especially if their internet access is restricted (for example, by their parents).</p>
<p>Maybe someday we won't need to fear being bullied, attacked, and murdered just because of who we are. I hope so. Thank you for reading this, and I hope this fraction of our community helps you.</p><hr>
