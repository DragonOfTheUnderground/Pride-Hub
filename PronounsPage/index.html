<p><b style="line-height: 1.7;">Chromosomal sex differentiation</b><br>
Having a certain set of sex chromosomes (X and Y).

A typical woman has 46, XX karyotype, while a typical man has 46, XY. Other configurations (examples of being intersex) are also possible, such as: 45, X0 (Turner syndrome); 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome); 47, XXX; 47, XYY.

It is also possible to possess a mosaic karyotype ( occurs when an individual has cells of various karyotypes originating from the same zygote), e.g. 45, X0/46, XY. If a person has cells originating in different zygotes which merged into one early on, we talk about . 

Finally, if a person with 46, XY karyotype lacks the SRY gene (typically found on the Y chromosome) which is crucial for the virilization of the foetus, their phenotype will be feminine. Conversly, if the SRY gene is found on one of the X chromosomes of a 46, XX person, they will have masculine phenotype (based on : 9-12).

Although medicine traditionally has (and, sadly, sometimes still does, see. interphobia) describe atypical sex characteristics as disorders, it is better to think of them as simply examples of human diversity.</p>

The same goes for Coeosexual, where an individual typically develops sexual feelings towards someone they don't know well.</p>

The social, legal and/or medical process of undoing part or all of one's transition. Detransition is possible only to a certain extent as some changes caused by hormone replacement therapy and surgeries are irreversible. The percentage of detransitioners is considerably low, lower than 1%; Danker et al. () provide a figure of 0,3%, Davies et al.  () - of 0,47%, Wiepjes et al. () write about 0,6% of interviewed trans women and 0,3% interviewed trans men who regretted  undergoing gonadectomy. The main reason reported for detransitioning is not a change or prior mistake in recognizing one's gender identity but social difficulties (discrimination or rejection by family). We may observe a tendency (especially in TERFs) to talk about an "epidemic of detransitions" in order to scare people away from transitioning, or in order to create a moral panic around being transgender, especially in regards to young trans men and AFAB non-binary people. Despite TERF propaganda, many detrans people who have had a change in gender identity and/or regret transitioning still support trans rights, with many still identifying as transgender or nonbinary.</p>

<p><b style="line-height: 1.7;">External genital differentiation</b><br>
The shape of a person's external genitals. These develop prenatally from the urogenital sinus due to the influence of hormones produced in the gonads. The 5α-reductase enzyme (produced in various places, including gonads, skin, and the nervous system) allows the testosterone produced by testes to convert into dihydrotestosterone, thanks to which the penis and scrotum develop. In case of low level of testosterone (in a foetus with ovaries), the urogenital sinus develops into the clitoris and labia. A less typical development of external genitals and/or their being "not alligned" with the internal genitals is also possible (these are various types of being intersex). Atypical levels of estro- and androgens may cause a foetus to develop "ambiguous" genitals, e.g.: micropenis/enlarged clitoris, bifid scrotum/labial fusion, hypospadias (having the urethra place not on the top of the penis but in the middle or below it), undescended testes (this happens in persons with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome). The shape of one's genitals may also spontaneously change later in life. For example, in people with 46, XY karyotype and congenital 5α-reductase deficiency, internal genitals are typically male (due to the effects of testosterone), but the lack of dihydrotestosterone leads to external genitals' feminization (although they usually are not typically female). Later, during puberty, other ways of producing dihydrotestosterone activate, and thanks to its effects the clitoris grows into a penis, ejaculation appears, the labia become a scrotum into which previously undescended testes move, phenotypical male characteristics appear, and the person's gender identity (usually) becomes masculine (due to the apperance of external genitals, 46, XY people with 5α-reductase deficiensy are raised as girls) (based on : 16-17, 28-33).</p>

<p><b style="line-height: 1.7;">Internal genital differentiation</b><br>
Having a certain type of internal sex organs.

In humans, these develop prenatally from two types of structures - Müllerian and Wolffian ducts - and their development is regulated by the hormones produced in the gonads. 

Testosterone produced in the testes causes the Wolffian ducts to develop into vas deferens and - together with the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH, also produced by the testes) - the Müllerian ducts to regress (they turn into vestigial organs - the prostatic utricle and the appendix testis).

Low levels of testosterone and AMH (in foetuses with ovaries) let the Müllerian ducts develop freely and form the uterine tubes, the uterus, and the upper part of the vagina). Without testosterone, the Wolffian ducts partially regress (in all people they also turn into the ureters).

A less typical development of internal genitals is also possible; their form also does not always "allign" with external genitals or non-primary sex characteristics. For example, in a person with a 46, XY karyotype with complete androgen insensitivity, the Wolffian ducts regress (because the body does not react to testosterone), while the AMH causes the Müllerian ducts to regress (at the same time, the person's external genitals and non-primary sex characteristics are feminine). A person with a 46, XX karyotype with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may have typically feminine internal genitals, while their external genitals are partially virilized (based on : 16-17).</p>

An example of internalized homophobia would be a queer woman who supports gay marriage, yet still feels guilty when imagining marrying a woman (despite being interested in marriage). However, internalized homophobia can also be projected outwardly. E.g. a gay politician who publicly makes homophobic comments.</p>

Because of this confusion in terminology, many people refer to the khanith as khanith alone.

Someone who is not cisgender and/or heterosexual and/or allosexual/alloromantic or someone with variant experiences with orientation, gender, and/or sex.
Historically, queer has been used as an epithet/slur against people whose gender, gender expression and/or sexuality do not conform to dominant societal expectations. However, people nowadays have reclaimed the term and self-identify in opposition to assimilation while to some, this reclamation is a celebration of not fitting into social norms.

Queer is also a label for those who don't want to put themselves in a specific box.

However, please note: Not every LGBTQIA person likes or uses the term queer and you should never refer to an individual as queer unless they specifically tell you that's what they want.</p>

The word “sex” is sometimes used interchangeably with “gender” (e.g. in legal documents). Also, “gender” and “gender identity” are often juxtaposed with “biological sex” in conversations about “biological men”/“biological women”, which is mistaken, because:

1) it erases the complexity of human sex differentiation;
2) usually, by saying “biological sex”, one refers to somebody’s gender assigned at birth based on the shape of their external genitals;
3) transgender people aren’t any less “biological” (whatever that means) than cis people are.</p>

A view in which in order to qualify as a "real" transgender person one must experience gender dysphoria and desire hormonal treatment and surgeries. Transemedicalists view being transgender  as a medical condition and transitioning as treatment. They may dismiss people who do not  experience dysphoria and non-binary people as "trans trenders" (based on : 7-8). It should be noted that the latest version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) does not classify being transgender as a mental disorder (which was the case in earlier versions). While explaining the change, it was noted that such classification was mistaken and contributed to stigmatization (see the official  by the World Health Organization concerning this issue).

Some opt for changing their legal gender marker, but not all. It should be noted that procedures of changing one's legal gender marker may be difficult or simply non-existent in certain countries; moreover, in many countries there is no option available for non-binary people.
