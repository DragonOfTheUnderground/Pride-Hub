        <h3>
            Common Sense Rainbow is a site dedicated to debunking anti LGBT+ arguments as well as providing educational information on LGBT+ topics. We have cataloged many hateful arguments and
            myths and refuted them using logic and research. We also write articles on LGBT+ topics and link to useful LGBT+ resources. This website is good for anyone who wants to
            educate themselves, anyone who wants to better fight bigots, people on the fence about supporting the LGBT+ movement, or LGBT+
            people who just want to read. Please share this site to maximize its impact.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <h3>
            This site was established to combat hate. If you have been following the news there has been
            a rise in anti-LGBT+ rhetoric, we hope to debunk a lot of the transphobic and homophobic arguments being used today.
            This site was also made to give LGBT+ people easy resources to fight bigots. Our site also helps non-LGBT+ and LGBT+ people alike learn more about LGBT+ issues and topics.

        <h4>Fixed the dates on the July 2022 LGBT+ News Recap because they were all messed up.</h4>
        <h4>The "People choose their sexuality" argument on the main page said sexuality was only caused by genes, while genes probably play a big role they are not the only factor.</h4>
        <h4>Made changes in "The Factors Increasing LGBT+ Identification" so the article better represented sexual fluidity and enviromental factors.</h4>
