            While the LGBT+ movement has come far LGBT+ people still face hatred. This hatred can have many effects on many parts of someone's life and this hatred is still widespread.<br><br>

75% of LGBT+ youth report discrimination and on top of that only 1 and 3 LGBT+ kids live in affirming homes. Over the past few years, transphobia has been on the rise and 30% of the US still opposes same sex marriage. <br><br>

Queerphobia often leads to direct violence. Hate crimes and murders are still being committed toward LGBT+ people. Tragically 2021 has been the deadliest year on record for transgender people with hundreds being murdered worldwide. Also, some countries still have the death penalty for being LGBT+. 
<br><br>
Direct violence is not the only effect of queerphobia. It has a big effect on mental health too. Suicide rates are much higher for LGBT+ people. Also, LGBT+ people have worse mental health. Also fighting hate is very beneficial. A survey found that transgender kids who had their pronouns and name respected had a 2x less chance of having suicidal thoughts compared to kids where no one respected their name and pronouns. On top of that kids who experienced no discrimination had much lower suicide rates than kids who experienced a lot. <br><br>

Hate can do much more than hurt mental health. LGBT+ are more likely to be homeless because of bigoted parents. Discrimination can affect many parts of life from income to access to health care to access to public spaces like bathrooms. <br><br>

Hate can ruin people's lives and for a more equal and happy world, we must fight it. Check out the rest of this website for debunking and responses to many hateful arguments and myths.
