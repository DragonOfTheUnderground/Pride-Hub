        <h2>
            A new <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/americans-support-for-key-lgbtq-rights-continues-to-tick-upward/">report</a> from the Public Religion Research Institute (<a href="https://prri.org/">PRRI</a>) studying support of LGBT+ rights in the US has found that public support for LGBT+ has continued to increase.<br><br>

Support is high for LGBT+ anti-discrimination <a href="equalityact.html">laws</a> which would protect LGBT+ people from discrimination in employment, housing and businesses at 79% of Americans. A further 41% strongly support these laws. This support is also across party lines with 89% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans supporting these laws.<br><br>

Support among religious groups is also high with the majority of people in all religious groups surveyed supporting anti-LGBT+ discrimination laws. Unitarian Universalists were the most supportive while Jehovah’s Witnesses were the least supportive though they were still at 59%. Around 80% of Catholics support these laws too.<br><br>

This support has increased over the years. Support among Americans has increased by 8% since 2015. Support among Democrats went up by 9% and support among Republicans went up by 4%. This increase has also been seen in all the surveyed religious groups.<br><br>

Opposition to religious exemption laws which would allow religious-based refusal of LGBT+ customers is decent at 66% of Americans opposing them. This opposition is more partisan than support for general anti-discrimination laws with 85% of Democrats and only 44% of Republicans opposing religious exemption laws.<br><br>

Opposition to religious exemption laws among religious groups is surprisingly high with the majority of people in all groups surveyed opposing such laws. Opposition to exemption laws has increased 9% since 2015 though it has fluctuated more than other issues.<br><br>

Support for <a href="marriage.html">same-sex marriage</a> is high at 68% of Americans. Same-sex marriage is a partisan issue with 81% of Democrats supporting it and only 48% of Republicans supporting it.<br><br>

Even among religious groups support is high with the majority of people in religious groups surveyed supporting it though many religious groups still don't officially endorse it.<br><br>

Support for same-sex marriage has greatly risen over time. Support increasing 14% since 2014. This increase has been seen in all groups.<br><br>

Surprisingly another <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/americas-growing-support-for-transgender-rights/">report</a> by PRRI found that only 4% of Americans knew that no federal protections exist at a federal level. More education about this lack of protection would be helpful. There is also a big gap in the opinions of individuals and people in power, 65% of Republicans support nondiscrimination laws while almost no Republicans in power support these laws.<br><br>

While support for general LGBT+ rights remains high and continues to increase, the situation for transgender rights remains more split. Support for general transgender rights is at 62% with only 47% of Republicans and 76% of Democrats supporting them. While this is promising other more nuanced yet still important rights don't have as much support. This data and data to come comes from another <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/most-americans-support-pro-lgbtq-policies-but-are-more-divided-over-transgender-sports-and-bathroom-policies/">survey</a>.<br><br>

Opposition to <a href="bathrooms.html">bathroom bills</a> that would effectively ban transgender people from public bathrooms while helping no one is only around 50%. support fell from 2017.<br><br>

Support for transgender military service is around 63%. Surprisingly, from 2017 to 2019 Republican support increased while Democrat support decreased. Support for transgender athletes is split around half and half.<br><br>

A <a href="https://19thnews.org/2022/03/republicans-split-blocking-gender-affirming-care-trans-youth-poll/">separate poll</a> found that objection to government intervention in <a href="../resources/studies/transition.html">life-saving gender-affirming care</a> was only 63%. Objection among Republicans was low at 46%.<br><br>

The stagnation and sometimes fall in support of these rights is explained by the increased polarization of Americans. For the past few years, Republicans have used LGBT+ and transgender people as political paws to rally support from conservative voters and to create a common enemy for the party.<br><br>

Education is key to stopping these attacks, if more people knew the <a href="../resources/studies/transition.html">science of gender-affirming care</a> or the <a href="damage.html">damage of discrimination,</a> more people would support LGBT+ rights.
