        <h2>
            The right of same-sex couples to adopt children is Important. Unfortunately, anti-LGBT+ groups have been spreading myths that sex same couples adopting children harm children. These claims are not backed up and go against the scientific consensus. Let's debunk these myths and look at the data.<br><br>

            Data from many scientific studies clearly show that same-sex adoption does not affect children. Some research has even found benefits of being raised by the same sex couple. An analysis conducted by the Australian Psychological Society that looked over dozens of other research papers found that children raised by same-sex parents were not affected by their orientation. The paper says "The research indicates that parenting practices and children’s outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favorable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families."<br><br>
            
            Another study done by the American Academy of Pediatrics came to the same conclusion. The study said "There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents’ sexual orientation and any measure of a child’s emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment."<br><br>
            
            Some studies have also found that kids raised in same-sex households can benefit. Some of the benefits observed include: kids being more LGBT+ friendly, kids holding fewer gender stereotypes, the workload in the house being distributed more equality, and better emotional health in kids though more data is needed to back up these claims.<br><br>
            
            Same-sex adoption rights also give many kids a home. In the US 115,000 kids are waiting to be adopted and this is not counting all the kids worldwide. If same-sex adoption rights did not exist in the US many more kids would be without a family and if more countries around the world allowed for same-sex adoption many more kids would be able to find A home.<br><br>
            
            The only disadvantage for kids in same-sex households is homophobia. While this does not have too much of an A effect it's still noticeable. The thing about this is that the people who attack same-sex adoption and marriage are adding to the problem. If homophobes would acknowledge facts and stop attacking gay people this would not be a problem.<br><br>
            
            One thing anti-LGBT+ are doing is misrepresenting studies. Sometimes studies are cited that show kids do better with 2 parents over 1 and then anti-LGBT+ people interpret this to mean kids need a woman in the family or a man in the family.
