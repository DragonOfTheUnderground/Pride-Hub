        <h2><a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-speaks-out-against-bills-harming-transgender-youth/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a></h2>
        <h3>"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that youth who identify as transgender have access to comprehensive, gender-affirming, and developmentally appropriate health care that is provided in a safe and inclusive clinical space."</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/advocacy-update/march-26-2021-state-advocacy-update">American Medical Association</a></h2>
        <h3>"research has demonstrated that improved body satisfaction and self-esteem following the receipt of gender-affirming care is protective against poorer mental health and supports healthy relationships with parents and peers. Studies also demonstrate dramatic reductions in suicide attempts, as well as decreased rates of depression and anxiety."</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Latest_News/AACAP_Statement_Responding_to_Efforts-to_ban_Evidence-Based_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse.aspx">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a></h2>
        <h3>"The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) supports the use of current evidence-based clinical care with minors. AACAP strongly opposes any efforts – legal, legislative, and otherwise – to block access to these recognized interventions. Blocking access to timely care has been shown to increase youths’ risk for suicidal ideation and other negative mental health outcomes."</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/position-statements/transgender-health">Endocrine Society</a></h2>
        <h3>"Those gender diverse youth who have barriers to accessing adequate healthcare have poorer overall physical and mental health compared to their cisgender peers.5 Over the last decade, there has been considerable research on and development of evidence-based standards of care that have proven to be both safe and efficacious for the treatment of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence in youth and adults. There is also a growing understanding of the positive impact that increased access to such treatments can have on the mental health of these individuals."</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File Library/About-APA/Organization-Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-Transgender-Gender-Diverse-Youth.pdf">American Psychiatric Association</a></h2>
        <h3>"The American Psychiatric Association: 1. Supports access to affirming and supportive treatment for trans and gender diverse youth and their families, including appropriate mental health services, and when indicated puberty suppression and medical transition support. 2. Opposes all legislative and other governmental attempts to limit access to these services for trans and gender diverse youth, or to sanction or criminalize the actions of physicians and other clinicians who provide them."</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.pdf">American Psychological Association</a></h2>
        <h3>"APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit, and necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals"</h3><br>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/family-physicians-stand-against-policies-that-criminalize-care-threaten-patient-physician-relationship.html">American Academy of Family Physicians</a></h2>
        <h3>"The American Academy of Family Physicians stands firmly against any policies that unnecessarily regulate the evidence-based practice of medicine, criminalize physicians and medical care, threaten the patient-physician relationship, and inhibit the delivery of safe, timely, and comprehensive care, including reproductive health services and information and gender-affirming care."</h3><br>
