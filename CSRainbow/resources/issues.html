        <h3>LGBT+ people face many issues around the world, this is a non comprehensive list of them.</h3>
        <h3>
            <hr>Adoption rights<br>
            ---<br>
            Same-sex couples deserve the same rights as everyone else and they make just as good parents as anyone else, and with millions of kids waiting for a family worldwide adoption rights for LGBT+ couples are important. Currently, while many countries have legalized same-sex adoption, many have not. A lot of countries also have requirements that adopters must be married, so if same-sex marriage is illegal then same-sex adoption would also be made illegal. Some places including some states in the US have laws that give religious adoption services a license to discriminate against same-sex couples.<br><br>

            <hr>Bathroom bills or access<br>
            ---<br>
            A bathroom bill is a harmful law that criminalizes transgender people from using the correct bathroom. Bathroom bills and ineffective and would do more harm than good. In some counties where transgender people can't legally transition, bathroom usage could be problematic. Some places have tried to implement bathroom bills, for example, North Caroline (though the law is now repealed). Other places like Alabama have tried to actualize bathroom bills that only target schools.<br><br>

            <hr>Censorship of LGBT+ topics<br>
            ---<br>
            Censorship of LGBT+ topics is harmful. It stops the advancement of equal rights, attacks freedom of speech and press, harms LGBT+ people, and could be considered a human rights violation. It can occur in several ways, like on a national scale where the promotion of LGBT+ topics is banned or in schools where discussion of LGBT+ people or issues can be suppressed. Fighting laws that do these things is a priority.<br><br>

            <hr>Conversion therapy<br>
            ---<br>
            Conversion therapy is the attempt to remove or suppress someone's LGBT+ status. It is harmful, ineffective practice objected to by almost all major medical groups, and it is particularly harmful when minors are subject to it. Many countries are banning conversion therapy for youth and almost 20 US states have banned it with even more working to limit it. In a survey, 11% of LGBT+ youth said they were threatened with conversion therapy and 6% said they were subject to it.<br><br>

            <hr>Criminalization of relationships<br>
            ---<br>
            Unfortunately, many countries still criminalize same-sex sexual activity. This is a human rights abuse. Luckily, more countries and moving away from this though there is still a lot of work to do. Punishments in countries where same-sex intimacy is banned can range from a fine to the death penalty.<br><br>

            <hr>Discrimination<br>
            ---<br>
            LGBT+ people are often targets of discrimination and implementing robust anti-discrimination laws is important. It's also crucial that protections don't have exceptions for people's prejudices so that people are fully protected. Protection from discrimination is one of the most popular LGBT+ policies and many countries have these protections. Unfortunately, discrimination can still be common and protections are sometimes hard to enforce.<br><br>

            <hr>Homophobia or transphobia<br>
            ---<br>
            Homophobia and transphobia are the roots of many of these problems, so addressing them will require addressing bigotry. While it can be hard to change people's minds, given time and actions it can happen. Anti-LGBT+ bigotry is still common in many places.<br><br>

            <hr>Recognition of relationships<br>
            ---<br>
            LGBT+ people in loving relationships deserve to get the legal recognition and rights everyone else does. Recognition of same-sex relationships can happen in several ways, the best way is marriage equality where same-sex couples can get the same legal rights as straight couples. Other ways include civil unions or domestic partnerships, while these statuses are helpful for same-sex couples they sometimes don't come with the same rights as marriage. Recognition of relationships and marriage equality has come a long way since the first places started recognizing it but many places don't have these rights in place. In the US same-sex couples have marriage equality though that right might be under threat.<br><br>

            <hr>Legal recognition of transgender people<br>
            ---<br>
            Legal recognition of transgender people is an important step in the transition. It often covers changing your name, driver's license, ID, or birth certificate. Legal recognition of gender reduces confusion and discrimination. Many places have this right though a lot of places have put limits on it. For example, some places need a court order, and proof of surgery to get documents amended, slowing down the process and making things harder for transgender people. Some places even require forced sterilization.<br><br>

            <hr>Transgender care access<br>
            ---<br>
            Access to transition saves lives. Study after study has shown medical transition is beneficial. Sadly, some places have tried to limit it, this can be in the form of removing coverage or banning transgender youth from accessing it. Long waitlists and confusing requirements also remain a problem.<br><br>

            <hr>Sexually transmitted diseases<br>
            ---<br>
            Some sexually transmitted diseases can disproportionately affect members of the LGBT+ community. Lack of access to sex education, protections or healthcare can make this problem worse.<br><br>
