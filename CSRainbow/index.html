                    1. Saying homosexuality is unnatural is simply not true. It has been documented in over 450 species of mammals worldwide and may come with certain evolutionary advantages.<br>
                    2. Even if homosexuality was unnatural this does not tell anything about it being bad. Many things people consider to be unnatural are good. For example modern medicine, housing, and computers. Also, many things people treat as natural are bad like getting killed by an animal, disease, and natural disasters.<br>

                    1. People say that accepting/being gay will lead to the acceptance/doing of other stuff like zoophilia or pedophilia. This is a slippery slope argument, just because people do one thing does not mean people will start doing another thing.<br>
                    2. The vast majority of LGBT+ people don't support <a class="jmplink" onclick="jumpto('11')">pedophilia</a> or zoophilia.<br>
                    3. Why can't this argument be used against heterosexuality, the only difference is the gender you are attracted to. One might say that heterosexuality is natural while being gay is not, but <a class="jmplink" onclick="jumpto('1')">this argument is flawed.</a><br>
                    4. Research shows gay people <a class="jmplink" onclick="jumpto('57')">don't</a> molest children at higher rates than others.<br>

                    1. This argument implies that the traditional definition of marriage (between a man and a woman) is inherently better. Just because something is old and has been done for a long time does not mean it's better. For example, slavery is an old "tradition" in many old civilizations but it's not good. The definition where gay people can get married is better because it gives them equal rights and allows them to participate in society more freely.<br>
                    2. Same-sex relationships did happen in many parts of the world throughout history.<br>

                    1. Just because a person thinks something is disgusting does not mean it's bad. People think some foods are disgusting but that does not mean the foods are bad for you or that they should be wiped from the face of the earth.<br>
                    2. The only difference between homosexuality and heterosexuality is the gender someone likes. There is nothing to be disgusted about.<br>

                <h3>
                    1. First of all, the definition of a mental disorder states that it must cause harm to a person or impair their function. Homosexuality does not do this, gay people live their life normally with the only difference being who they are attracted to.<br>
                    2. Homosexuality is not in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), it was removed in the DSM-3-R in 1973.<br>
                    3. Today, major medical groups don't consider homosexuality to be a disorder. For example, the American Psychological Association applauded the decision to depathologize homosexuality and called for the ending of discrimination against gay people.<br>
                    4. Even if homosexuality was a mental disorder why should people deny gay people rights? It would still be discrimination.<br>
                    5. If being gay was considered a mental disorder, why would this matter? A mental disorder is just a label and being gay does not reduce people's ability to function.<br>

                    1. Some people like to say that being transgender or nonbinary is just a recent trend. This is wrong and transgender and nonbinary people have been found throughout history.<br>
                    2. While it is true more people identify as transgender/nonbinary now then before, much of this is because of the LGBT+ movement helping people find out about their idenities or be more comfortable coming out.
                    3. You could call it a "trend" it's better than the trend of being stuck with gender dysphoria and having nothing to do about it.<br>

                <h2 id="10">Giving bathroom rights to transgender people puts cisgender women in danger</h2>
                <h3>
                    1. Bans on transgender people from using the correct bathroom are misguided, for starters, these bans don't protect cisgender women. If someone wanted to sexually assault women in a bathroom, be it a transgender woman or a cisgender man dressed as a woman, a bathroom ban would not deter them. Sexual assault is already illegal with harsh penalties. So if someone tries to sexually assault people regardless of the punishments, the much smaller penalties imposed by a bathroom ban would do nothing to stop them. Research indicates that policies that ban transgender bathroom discrimination do not affect the number of sexual assaults.<br>
                    2. While bathroom bans do nothing to help cisgender women, they do serious harm to transgender people. Implementing bathroom bans would put transgender people in an unwinnable situation. They could use the bathroom matching their assigned sex at birth, which would open them up to sexual assault and harassment. A study found schools with discriminatory bathroom policies had to increase in sexual assaults for transgender youth. They could use the bathroom matching their gender identity, which would put them at risk of legal trouble. Finally, they could detransition in public which would lead to increased gender dysphoria, worse mental health and damage their freedom of expression.<br>
                    3. Research links bathroom bans to worse mental health for transgender people. One study found that transgender youth who faced bathroom discrimination were more likely to consider suicide and have worse mental health. Research also suggests that transgender-inclusive environments which would include bathroom accommodations lead to better mental health for transgender people.<br>
                    4. Many experts and groups oppose bathroom bans. An open letter signed by many sexual assault prevention organizations opposed bathroom bans. Many medical groups like the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics also oppose bathroom restrictions.<br>
                    5. If bathroom bans were implemented, they would be very hard to enforce. Using IDs would be impractical and going off looks would fail to catch many people. Enforcing bathroom bans would also waste useful police resources that would have been better spent fighting real sexual predators.<br>
                    6. Another issue with enforcing bathroom bans and with transgender bathroom discrimination in general is that it would affect cisgender people. Because looks would be the only practical way to enforce bathroom bans, cisgender women who do not look feminine enough or cisgender men who do not look masculine enough would be kicked from bathrooms and discriminated against. This has happened before, there are real cases of cisgender women be harassed for using the women's bathroom after being mistaken for being transgender women. This type of side effect of bathroom bans would also hurt freedom of expression.<br>
                    7. Transgender people have had access to bathrooms for years with little issue. Even though isolated cases of transgender people assaulting people in bathrooms exist, this is not an excuse to pass bathroom bans because the actions of one person don't represent an entire group.<br>

                    mainly tells kids that LGBT+ people exist and that's ok. It's not forcing kids to become LGBT+.

                    3. Education will lead to an increase of people who are out but this is because education helps
                    kids find who they are. The kids were LGBT+ in the first place they just found who they were.<br>

                    See this page <a href="articles/transition.html">here</a> for a more in depth look at this argument<br><br>
                
                    1. Transition has been shown to better people's mental health in many studies. One meta-analysis found that, out of 55 studies, 51 concluded transition was effective, the other 4 showed inconclusive or mixed results but not negative.<br>
                    2. Regret and detransition rates are low for transition, studies on average find that 97% of transgender people don't regret their transition.<br> Detransition is often not even caused by someone not being transgender, it's often caused by transphobia or social pressure.<br>
                    3. While some studies claim to show transition is ineffective these studies are in the minority and often have flaws.<br>
                    4. Many medical organizations support the fact that transition works.<br>
                    5. While there are side effects, most experts agree that the benefits outway the harms. People are also closely monitored during treatment so treatment it can be altered or stopped if side effects present problems. Also, we don't ban anti-depressants because they can sometimes present side effects.<br>
                    6. Before transitioning, people are screened by experts and will have time to make an informed decision.<br>
                    7. The same medicine used in transition is used in other types of treatment with little controversy.<br>
                    8. One claim sometimes made is that because money can be a motive behind gender-affiriming care it's inherently bad. However this claim is flawed, money does not decide whether a treatment is good or bad because good treatments often cost money.<br>

                    1. The notion that gender is purely biological and innate is problematic in many ways. For staters biology is not innate, many parts of biology like genital structure and secondary sex characteristics can be changed.<br>
                    2. Another problem is that purely using biology to define gender is not useful, in many real world situations, biology takes a back seat to other characteristics.<br>
                    3. Defining gender purely using biology also does not give credit to other characteristics associated with gender like expression and psychology.<br>
                    4. Now that we have shown that using only biology is not a good way of looking at gender in most contexts, we can talk about transgender people. Transgender people are able to change many useful and important characteristics associated with gender. If someone identifies as a gender, presents as a gender, medically transitions to that gender and everyone knows them as that gender then they might as well be that gender.<br>
                    5. One particularly important characteristic is gender identity. Respecting gender identity is a good idea because of mental health considerations and because it's very real to people.<br>

                    1. A lot of TERFs say biological sex is more important than gender and a lot of their
                    arguments hinge on this. This is wrong. Biological sex is almost never used in day-to-day life and does not determine how people treat you.<br>
                    2. While biological sex might be important in a relationship or the doctor's office these are edge cases and
                    still do not make biological sex more important than gender in day-to-day life.<br>
                    3. Some TERFs say that gender being a social construct makes it unimportant. This is wrong
                    many social constructs are important for example money is a social construct and people

                    1. There is no evidence that says same-sex marriage harms children. Some studies even
                    find it's beneficial for kids.<br>
                    2. Some people say that same-sex marriage is harmful because of the disconnect between the child
                    and parent but if this is true then why can't this argument be used against opposite-sex families
                    that adopt children? Adopting children is generally considered good so aren't same-sex parents doing
                    Service to this world?<br>
                    3. A real problem is that kids of same-sex parents might be attacked because of their parents being

                    2. Transgender and nonbinary people need more representation. They are more oppressed than the average woman and more representation would defiantly be helpful.<br>
                    3. Inclusive language is also helpful to cisgender people, saying pregnant person shows that not all women can get pregnant much more
                    directly.
                    4. We are not advocating for the destruction of free speech. We just think inclusive language is better than gendered language
                    and that it should be used more in appropriate settings. Inclusive language is also mainly used when addressing large amounts of people

                <h2 id="25">Rapid onset gender dysphoria</h2>
                <h3>
                    1. Rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD) is a disputed diagnosis and theory that gender dysphoria and being transgender is a social contagion that spreads through peer influence. It's often used by people to invalidate transgender identity or explain the rise in transgender identification. Much of the fuss around ROGD arose because of a study popularized that term and claimed to have observed it. The study surveyed parents of transgender kids and concluded based on responses that the kids had ROGD. However, this study has some major flaws.<br>
                    2. First of all, the study surveyed parents, not their kids. Because transgender kids are often quiet about their identities, parents are not the best source of information. This is especially true for the rapid onset part of ROGD the study claimed to observe. Because people are often silent about their identities until coming out, it might only seem like rapid onset to someone watching.<br>
                    3. All of this is made worse by the fact the source of data was biased. The parents in the study were recruited from anti-transgender websites like transgender trend and 4thwavenow. This would make an unreliable source of data about transgender kids even more unreliable. While some may claim that most of the parents were actually supportive of their child because 88.2% said they supported transgender rights, this assertion has some issues. First, many might have interpreted the question to mean general protections like nondiscrimination laws and not more nuanced things like whether they accepted their child. Second and more damming, 76.5% of parents thought their child was incorrect in identifying as transgender. <br>
                    4. The study also has other issues. For example, it made no mention of best-practice methods for conducting surveys and gave parents a simplified and un-verified version of the DSM-5 to "diagnose" their kids with gender dysphoria.<br>
                    5. The study's conclusions and many claims about ROGD in general also seem flawed. It was suggested that adolescents consuming transgender-related social media make them transgender, but it could easily be the opposite. If someone found out they were transgender or were questioning their gender identity, they would probably seek advice or information online. This reasoning also addresses the claim that transgender friends can make someone transgender. Because if someone is transgender they might seek out friends who have that thing in common, or if someone has a transgender friend, they might be more comfortable coming out.<br>
                    6. Some research has found issues with the notion of ROGD. One study was not able to replicate some of ROGD's predictions concluding, "We did not find support within a clinical population for a new etiologic phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria during adolescence."<br>
                    7. Another issue with ROGD is that it frames people finding out they are transgender during or after puberty with little signs before puberty as novel and evidence of social contagion. However, this reasoning is flawed because this phenomenon is not novel and has been observed before all the fuss about social contagion. It is also not good evidence in favor of social contagion because puberty often causes people to discover their gender identity or worsens dysphoria.<br>
                    8. Many transgender people also find out about their identity before puberty which is not predicted by ROGD. One study found that most transgender adults first began experiencing gender dysphoria between ages 3 and 7.<br>
                    10. It's hard to think that social factors can push someone to identify as transgender given all the hardship transgender people have to go through and the magnitude of the decision.<br>
                    11. Many medical organizations have opposed the use of ROGD citing the lack of medical evidence.<br>
                    12. All of this is not to say ROGD does not exist in any way whatsoever, there is just no good evidence for ROGD individuals making up a large portion of the transgender population like some claim. Even if ROGD was real and significant, it would not change too much. Arguments for transgender rights and protections are not hurt by the way someone becomes transgender. Things that might need to be changed would be the caution taken by people transitioning and the way people are educated about transgender issues.<br>

                <h3>
                    1. This is wrong. Sexuality is determined by a mix of factors and is not a choice. Many of these factors are biological. A genome-wide association study
                    was run by tens of thousands of people and a large number of genes were associated with homosexuality. Twin studies have also been run showing genetic correlation.<br>
                    2. Sexuality having some biological roots does not mean sexuality can't be fluid it just
                    means people's "base" sexualities are set. For example, many people who identify as
                    straight can still have some amount of same-sex attraction from time to time but
                    they don't stop being heterosexual at their core. This is all different from sexuality being a choice, I don't choose the fluidity.<br>
                    3. Even if sexuality was a choice why would that matter, it's no one's business.<br>

                    1. I'm not as confident writing about bible passages and this one is a bit more complex than the other ones. For
                    information on this verse please read to sources in the description. I might try to write someone on this later.
                    I will still copy some of the affirming interpretations below.<br><br></h3><h4>

                    2. "Human sexuality researchers and others who have studied the nature of sexual orientation might reject Paul's belief
                    that homosexuality is beyond the normal. Many religious liberals reject Paul's condemnation of homosexual behavior,
                    particularly when Paul's support for the oppression of women, and his acceptance of slavery as a normal social practice
                    in (Philemon 1:15 to 16) are considered. They might feel that this passage in 1 Romans should be rejected as immoral and
                    outside the will of God, much as other biblical passages are immoral by today's ethical standards and should be ignored
                    including those passages that regulated human slavery, required some hookers to be burned alive, advocated genocide,
                    required victims of rape to marry their rapist, allowed the torture of prisoners, and required the execution of
                    non-virgin brides."<br><br>

                    3. "Paul didn't write it as a condemnation of homosexuality, but as a criticism of Greek behavior in temple worship.
                    Greeks often incorporated sexual behavior in temple worship." - J. Nelson<br><br>

                    4. "The complete passage describes how a group of Christians left the church, converted to Paganism, and engaged in
                    orgiastic, presumably heterosexual sexual activities. This type of behavior was common among Pagan fertility religions
                    in Rome during Paul's time. Paul writes that, later, God "gave them over" to something new: homosexual behavior. This
                    implies that they had a heterosexual orientation and had engaged only in heterosexual sex throughout their lifetime.
                    God influenced them in some way to engage in homosexual orgies. This was, for them, an unnatural, and thus sinful, activity.
                    Paul  criticized them because they were engaged in sexual activity which was unnatural for them. For a person with 
                    a heterosexual orientation, homosexual behavior is "shameful," "unnatural," "indecent," and a "perversion." The passage
                    in Romans is not a condemnation of homosexual behavior. Rather, it disapproves of sexual behavior that is against a
                    person's basic nature (i.e. homosexual behaviors by people whose orientation is heterosexual)." - Dr. Swiney<br><br>

                    5. "Some question whether the word "perversion" in Verse 27, and "such things" in Verse 30 are related to only certain
                    types of gay and lesbian behavior. e.g.: Homosexual orgies, or Group same-gender sexual practices in a religious setting. 
                    This was a common practice among Pagans at the time; e.g. in the temples dedicated to the Goddess Aphrodite.
                    Casual homosexual activities outside of a committed, monogamous two person relationship, or Homosexual molestation between
                    a man and a child. In Paul's day, the child victim was often a slave. These probably were the only forms of same-sex
                    activity that Paul was familiar with. Paul may well have not been thinking of gays and lesbians in committed relationships
                    when he wrote this passage. He never referred to such couples in his writings, and may well have never encountered any 
                    during his lifetime. He might simply have been condemning homosexual orgies and other sexual activities outside of a 
                    monogamous same-sex relationship."<br></h4><h3>

                    1. Many other bible passages are considered immoral today and are disregarded.<br>
                    2. Many translations go with men who have sex with male prostitutes or men who engage in adultery. These would not apply
                    to loving and consenting same-sex relationships.<br>
                    3. As I'm not as confident writing about bible passages please check out some of the sources in the description for more
                    information.<br>
                    4. When these sections were made homosexuality was almost always in the context of rape, not consenting relationships.<br>

                    2. More specific arguments against asexuals are also incorrect. For example, the view that asexuals should be excluded from the LGBT+ community (ace exclusionism) because they are not oppressed is bad logic. First of all, while some forms of discrimination against asexuals are rare, asexuals still face many struggles. Second, ace exclusionism subverts the idea that the LGBT+ community is an inclusive place for all sexual minorities.<br>

                    1. Autogynephilia is the idea that people transition because they are aroused by the thought of themselves as the other gender. The autogynephilia theory does not line up with what transgender people say. For this theory to be true most transgender people
                    must be lying and with the transgender community having hundreds of thousands of members this is inconceivable. Claiming that all
                    transgender people are lying also makes the theory unfalsifiable by making it impossible to get counterevidence which is 
                    <a href="https://explorable.com/falsifiability">very problematic.</a><br>
                    2. Transition is a long, hard and expensive process it seems very unlikely that anyone would go through it just because of autogynephilia.<br>
                    3. We are not saying no one has autogynephilia there are certainly one-off cases. The problem is autogynephilia has not been seen
                    on a wide scale.<br>
                    4. The medical community agrees that autogynephilia is mostly fake. See the sources for more information on problems with autogynephilia and
                    academic responses to it.<br>

                    3. Kids have to go through exams before getting treatment and are overseen by experts so it's hard to say they are rushed.<br>
                    4. Because questioning, coming out, and seeking treatment can take a long time kids will have a better sense of what they are.<br>

                    1. Conversion therapy in the context of sexual orientation has been proven to be ineffective. While they said data is somewhat lacking a review from a medical organization found conversion therapy to be ineffective. These results were backed up by a meta-study that analyzed 13 different studies, 12 of the 13 said conversion therapy was ineffective. The 1 study that claimed conversion therapy worked was run on a purely religious sample which could lead to bias such as people repressing feelings or being in denial and it only found the practice was effective in a minority of the participants.<br>
                    2. While there is less research on the effectiveness of transgender conversion therapy, it's generally regarded as not effective.<br>
                    3. Conversion therapy is extremely harmful, many studies have found that conversion therapy causes effects like increased suicide rates, depression, and anxiety.<br>
                    4. Most major medical organizations have condemned conversion therapy and called for a ban.<br>

                <h3>
                    1. Not being able to legally change gender can make many parts of life harder. For example, incorrect identification can be an issue at security check points, at traffic stops or during voting.<br>
                    2. It's hard to argue that transgender people should not be able to legally change their gender when transgender people can change many of their gender characteristics. If someone identifies as a gender, presents as a gender, medically transitions to that gender, lives life as that gender and everyone knows them as that gender, they should be able to get legal recognition.<br>
                    3. Incorrect identity documents can out transgender people which can lead to harmful situations.<br>
                    4. Because the main person being affected by an identification change is that person, changing legal gender is a matter of personal freedom which is another reason it should be allowed.<br>
                    5. Research has suggested that access to legal gender change improves quality of life and mental health for transgender people.<br>
                    6. The argument that allowing transgender to change legal gender will allow men access to single-sex spaces for women is flawed. First of all, the process for identity change can often being challenging or take time which would remove incentive or straight up prevent people from abusing the system. Second, having the fake documents won't make much of a difference, it's not like they check IDs outside of bathrooms.<br>
                    7. The argument that allowing transgender to change legal gender will endanger cisgender women in single-sex spaces is also flawed and is coved <a class="jmplink" onclick="jumpto('10')">here.</a><br>

However, what someone's body is supposed to be is not a reality, it's a preference placed on them by others. Reality is what something is, not what something is supposed to be.

                <h3>
                    1. Even though there is a difference between the performance of men and women in sports, medical transition reduces this advantage. This advantage would also be decreased for students before puberty.<br>
                    2. Sports is already inherently unfair and people come in with biological advantages all the time, but this rarely seems to matter. For example Michael Phelps’s body gives him an advantage in swimming and yet we don't ban him. This coupled with the fact we should view transgender people as the <a class="jmplink" onclick="jumpto('14')">gender</a> they are makes it logical that transgender people should be included.<br>
                    3. For students, competition is not the only thing that comes out of sports. The value of mental health and physical well being can not be understated. Banning transgender students would stop them from being able to access these advantages.<br>
                    4. Policies that allow transgender people in compete in sports more fairly already exist in schools and athletic groups. The government has no business intruding on those policies.<br>
                    5. Policies that ban transgender athletes also limit the rights of intersex athletes. This is particularly apparent for bans on transgender student sports, these bans rarely include protections for intersex students so they would effectively be banned from gender segregated sports.<br>
                    6. Attempts to completely ban transgender people from sports ignore that compromises are possible. For example, things could be handled on a case by case basis. This would be better than a ban because it's inaccurate to paint every transgender person as having an advantage when there are variations in individual preformace.<br>
