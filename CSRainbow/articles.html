                  With anti-LGBT+ rhetoric on the rise, opposition to drag shows is too. This opposition mainly manifested as protests and harassment directed at family-friendly drag shows and drag queen story hours. But things have been escalating recently, right-wing lawmakers across the United States have introduced legislation to restrict drag shows and sometimes gender nonconformity in general. Some of these laws are dangerous and would heavily limit transgender rights and freedom of expression if passed.

                <h3>
                  Several years ago in Florida, 2 conversion therapists sued Palm Beach county over their ban on the harmful practice of conversion therapy for minors. They argued that the ban violated their right to freedom of speech. While they weren't able to block the law at first when they appealed to the circuit court, the court agreed in a 2-1 decision, and the ban was struck down. Unfortunately, it gets worse, because the circuit court had jurisdiction over Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, any attempt to ban conversion therapy in those states would be halted too. This reveals a major roadblock to banning conversion therapy, conservative judges striking bans down.

                  Gender transition is the process a transgender person takes to align their body and expression with their gender identity. Transition is often driven by gender dysphoria which is a sometimes severe discomfort felt by transgender people over their body or gender roles. Transition generally improves the well-being of transgender people and is a goal for many of them.

Several LGBT+ and civil rights groups quickly filed a lawsuit which will be the topic of this article.
